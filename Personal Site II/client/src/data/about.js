        'Hello, my name is Tim. Ever since my first introduction with programming a few years ago, I have been captivated by the freedom and creative expression that it presents. Ever since I can remember, I have always loved being able to create cool things from nothing. Starting with the oh so fantastic Lego, and eventually turning towards software development. Although I do not have too much experience currently, I hope to persue a career in software development. As I go on my journey to teach myself all about software development, my progression will be documented here.'
